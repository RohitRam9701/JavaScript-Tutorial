            <h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
            <hr />
            <p>
                Welcome to the world of JavaScript! Today, having a solid
                understanding of JavaScript is crucial for anyone who wants to
                pursue a career in web development. With its versatility and
                wide-range of applications, JavaScript is one of the most
                important programming languages to learn. But don't worry, we'll
                start from the basics and gradually raise the bar. By the end of
                these tutorials, you'll be well on your way to becoming a
                JavaScript pro.

            <h2>What is Programming?</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
                Programming is the art of communicating with computers. Just
                like some of your friends might understand Hindi, others might
                understand English, computers understand programming. Think of
                it as a language that we use to tell computers what to do.
            </p>

            <h2>The Dumb Computer</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
                Despite its incredible speed and accuracy, a computer is
                actually quite "dumb." It can only do exactly what you tell it
                to do, and nothing more. This means that you have to be very
                clear and precise in your instructions, or else the computer
                might do something unexpected. For example, if you asked a
                person to jump, they would probably know what you meant. But if
                you asked a computer to jump, it wouldn't have a clue!
            </p>
            <p>
                This might sound like a hindrance, but it's actually one of the
                things that makes computers so useful. They can perform complex
                calculations and processes much faster than a person ever could.
                For example, if you asked a person to solve the equation ( 24 +
                5 ), they might take a few seconds to give you the answer of 29.
                But a computer would solve that equation almost instantly.
            </p>

            <h2>ECMAScript: The Standard Behind JavaScript</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
                ECMAScript is the standardized version of JavaScript that helps
                ensure that code written in JavaScript will work the same way on
                any computer. ECMAScript has come a long way since its
                inception, with new features and capabilities added with each
                new release. In most cases, "JavaScript" and "ECMAScript" can be
                used interchangeably.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the great things about JavaScript is that it's a very
                forgiving language. It tries to do something with the code you
                write, even if it's not exactly right, and will only throw an
                error if you've really messed up.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Use JavaScript</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>There are several ways to use JavaScript, including:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In the browser: Most modern browsers have a JavaScript
                    console that you can use to test and run your code.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    In HTML: You can add JavaScript to your HTML files and run
                    it in the browser. This is a great way to add interactivity
                    to your website.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    With a runtime environment: One popular runtime environment
                    for JavaScript is Node.js. Node.js was created when a
                    programmer named Ryan Dahl took Google's V8 JavaScript
                    engine and wrapped it in C++. This allows you to run
                    JavaScript code outside of the browser, which is useful for
                    server-side programming.
                </li>
                <br />
            </ol>
            <p>
                And, as a bonus, you can also use JavaScript in Replit, even if
                your computer's specs are low or you're on the go.
            </p>

            <p>
                In conclusion, learning JavaScript will open up a world of
                possibilities for you. With its versatility and wide range of
                applications, there's no limit to what you can accomplish with
                this powerful programming language. So let's get started!
