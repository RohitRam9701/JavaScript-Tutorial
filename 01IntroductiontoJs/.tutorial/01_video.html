      <p>
        In JavaScript, semicolons are used to terminate statements. While
        JavaScript allows you to omit semicolons in some cases due to automatic
        semicolon insertion, it's a good practice to use them consistently to
        prevent unexpected behavior in your code. Here's where you should use
        semicolons in JavaScript:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          After Statements: Terminate each statement with a semicolon. For
          example:
          <pre>
let x = 5;
console.log(x); 
                </pre
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          After Function Expressions: When defining a function expression,
          terminate it with a semicolon if it's not the end of a block
          statement. For example:
          <pre>
const myFunction = function() {
    // function body
};
            </pre
          >
        </li>

        <li>
          After return, break, and continue statements: Terminate these
          statements with a semicolon. For example:
          <pre>
function myFunction() {
    return true;
}
            </pre
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          After Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE): Terminate IIFE
          with a semicolon to prevent potential issues with surrounding code.
          For example:
          <pre>
(function() {
    // code
})();
            </pre
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          In for loops: Terminate the initialization, condition, and iteration
          parts of a for loop with semicolons. For example:
          <pre>
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // loop body
}
            </pre
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          In switch statements: Terminate each case and default block with a
          semicolon. For example:
          <pre>
switch (expression) {
  case x:
    // code
    break;
  default:
    // code
    break;
}
            </pre
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          In object literals: When defining object literals on separate lines,
          it's good practice to terminate each property with a semicolon. For
          example:
          <pre>
const myObject = {
  property1: 'value1',
  property2: 'value2',
};
            </pre
          >
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Remember that while JavaScript allows for some flexibility in semicolon
        usage, it's best to adopt a consistent approach to enhance code
        readability and avoid unexpected errors.

      <h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Welcome to the world of JavaScript! Today, having a solid understanding
        of JavaScript is crucial for anyone who wants to pursue a career in web
        development. With its versatility and wide-range of applications,
        JavaScript is one of the most important programming languages to learn.
        But don't worry, we'll start from the basics and gradually raise the
        bar. By the end of these tutorials, you'll be well on your way to
        becoming a JavaScript pro.

      <h2>What is Programming?</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Programming is the art of communicating with computers. Just like some
        of your friends might understand Hindi, others might understand English,
        computers understand programming. Think of it as a language that we use
        to tell computers what to do.
      </p>

      <h2>The Dumb Computer</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Despite its incredible speed and accuracy, a computer is actually quite
        "dumb." It can only do exactly what you tell it to do, and nothing more.
        This means that you have to be very clear and precise in your
        instructions, or else the computer might do something unexpected. For
        example, if you asked a person to jump, they would probably know what
        you meant. But if you asked a computer to jump, it wouldn't have a clue!
      </p>
      <p>
        This might sound like a hindrance, but it's actually one of the things
        that makes computers so useful. They can perform complex calculations
        and processes much faster than a person ever could. For example, if you
        asked a person to solve the equation ( 24 + 5 ), they might take a few
        seconds to give you the answer of 29. But a computer would solve that
        equation almost instantly.
      </p>

      <h2>ECMAScript: The Standard Behind JavaScript</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        ECMAScript is the standardized version of JavaScript that helps ensure
        that code written in JavaScript will work the same way on any computer.
        ECMAScript has come a long way since its inception, with new features
        and capabilities added with each new release. In most cases,
        "JavaScript" and "ECMAScript" can be used interchangeably.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the great things about JavaScript is that it's a very forgiving
        language. It tries to do something with the code you write, even if it's
        not exactly right, and will only throw an error if you've really messed
        up.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Use JavaScript</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>There are several ways to use JavaScript, including:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In the browser: Most modern browsers have a JavaScript console that
          you can use to test and run your code.
        </li>
        <li>
          In HTML: You can add JavaScript to your HTML files and run it in the
          browser. This is a great way to add interactivity to your website.
        </li>
        <li>
          With a runtime environment: One popular runtime environment for
          JavaScript is Node.js. Node.js was created when a programmer named
          Ryan Dahl took Google's V8 JavaScript engine and wrapped it in C++.
          This allows you to run JavaScript code outside of the browser, which
          is useful for server-side programming.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        And, as a bonus, you can also use JavaScript in Replit, even if your
        computer's specs are low or you're on the go.
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, learning JavaScript will open up a world of possibilities
        for you. With its versatility and wide range of applications, there's no
        limit to what you can accomplish with this powerful programming
        language. So let's get started!
