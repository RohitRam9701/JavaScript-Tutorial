# Loops

Loops are used to perform repetitive tasks in programming. For example, if you wanted to print something 20 times, you could do it manually, but what if you needed to print it 20,000 times? That's where loops come in handy.

There are 5 types of loops in JavaScript:

1. `for` loop
2. `for-in` loop
3. `for-of` loop
4. `while` loop
5. `do-while` loop

In this lesson, we'll learn about the first 3 types of loops.

# For Loops

The syntax for a for loop is as follows:

```js
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

Statement 1 is executed once before the loop starts. Statement 2 is checked at the beginning of each iteration, and if it's true, the code block is executed. After the code block has been executed, statement 3 is executed, and then the condition is checked again. This process repeats until the condition is no longer true.

Here's an example of using a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 29:

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 29; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

This code will print the numbers from 1 to 29 to the console. As you can see, using a for loop makes it much easier to perform repetitive tasks like this.

## Summing Numbers with a for Loop

Here's an example of using a for loop to sum the first n numbers, where n is entered by the user:

```js
let n = prompt("Enter a number");
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
  sum = sum + i;
}
console.log("The sum of first " + n + " numbers is " + sum);
```

This code is used to calculate the sum of the first n numbers where `n` is provided by the user through a prompt. The code uses a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to n and add them to a variable called `sum`.

The for loop starts by initializing a loop variable `i` to 1, and checking if it is less than or equal to the value of `n`. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed, which adds the value of `i` to the `sum` variable. The loop then increments the value of `i` by 1 and repeats the process until the condition becomes `false`.

Finally, the code prints out the result of the sum using `console.log()`, which concatenates strings and variables to create a message that displays the value of `n` and the sum of the first `n` numbers.

# For-In Loops

**`for-in` loop**: A for-in loop is a variant of the for loop that is used to iterate over the properties of an object.

- Iterates over the **keys** (property names) of an object.
- Useful for iterating through object properties.
- The syntax is as follows:

```js
for (let property in object) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

- Here's an example of using a for-in loop to iterate over the properties of an object:

```javascript
let person = {
  name: "Harry",
  age: 30,
  gender: "male",
};

for (let x in person) {
  console.log(x + ": " + person[x]);
}
```

This code will print each property of the person object and its corresponding value to the console.

- Not recommended for arrays because it can also iterate over non-index properties (like custom added properties). For example:
  ```javascript
  const arr = [3, 5, 7];
  arr.foo = "hello"; // added property
  for (const key in arr) {
    console.log(key); // Logs "0", "1", "2", "foo"
  }
  console.log(arr); // output: both keys and values
  ```

# For-Of Loops

**`for-of` loop**: A for-of loop is another variant of the for loop that is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays and strings.

- Iterates over the **values** of an iterable object (arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.) and provides direct access to their values.
- Specifically designed for arrays and other iterable data structures.
- The syntax is as follows:

```javascript
for (let value of iterable) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

- Example:
  ```javascript
  const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];
  let text = "";
  for (const car of cars) {
    text += car;
  }
  // Result: "BMWVolvoMini"
  ```
- Here's an another example of using a for-of loop to iterate over the elements of an array:

```typescript
//  to loop through array elements without dealing with indices*
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let number of numbers) {
  console.log(number);
}
```

This code will print each element of the numbers array to the console.

- Ignores (avoids) non-index properties (like custom added properties) as it directly iterates over values. For example:

```javascript
const arr = [3, 5, 7];
arr.foo = "hello"; // added property
for (const value of arr) {
  console.log(value); // Logs "3", "5", "7" (no "hello" here!)
}
console.log(arr); // output: both keys and values
```

Note that we will be using for-in and for-of loops extensively when working with arrays, which we will cover later in this course.

# Conclusion

Loops are a fundamental programming concept used to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. JavaScript offers five types of loops: **for, for-in, for-of, while,** and **do-while**.

For loops are commonly used for iterating over a sequence of numbers or a list of items. For-in loops are used for iterating over the properties of an object, and for-of loops are used for iterating over iterable objects such as arrays and strings. Understanding how to use loops effectively is essential for writing efficient and readable code in JavaScript.

We will discuss while and do-while loops in our next tutorial.

**For loops** are fundamental in programming and have various real-life applications. Let's explore some examples:

1. **Iterating Through Lists**:
   - A common use case is iterating through a list of items (e.g., elements in an array, database records, or files).
   - For instance, you might process each student's exam scores, calculate averages, or filter data based on specific conditions.

2. **Repetitive Tasks**:
   - When you have a repetitive task that needs to be performed multiple times, a for loop is handy.
   - Examples include printing numbers from 1 to 100, generating a sequence of dates, or simulating game rounds.

3. **Data Analysis and Statistics**:
   - In data analysis, loops are used to iterate through large datasets.
   - You can calculate averages, find maximum or minimum values, or apply transformations to each data point.

4. **Game Development**:
   - Game loops often use iterations to update game states, handle player actions, and manage animations.
   - For example, dealing cards in a poker game involves a loop that distributes cards to players.

Remember, for loops are powerful tools for automating repetitive tasks and processing data efficiently! ðŸš€


* `*` indices
```js
// Example 1: Array Indices
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

// An index refers to the position of an element within an array.
// Arrays are zero-indexed, so the first element has an index of 0.
console.log(fruits[0]); // Prints "apple"
console.log(fruits[1]); // Prints "banana"

// Example 2: String Indices
const message = "Hello, world!";

// Each character in a string has an associated index (starting from 0).
console.log(message[7]); // Prints "w"

// Example 3: Map (Associating Values with Keys)
const userMap = new Map();
userMap.set("name", "Alice");
userMap.set("age", 30);

// Retrieving values using keys (indices)
console.log(userMap.get("name")); // Prints "Alice"
console.log(userMap.get("age")); // Prints 30
// 
```
